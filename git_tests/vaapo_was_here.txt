Did change git to work over ssh and also created the gpg2 keys.
Oh boy what a task, had lack of entropy and such shit with the gpg2.
This directory is reserved just to test that my git setup is ok and usable from VisualStudio code.

And it seems it works beautifully from VisualStudio code.
No more ugly enter user and pass to git stuff.
